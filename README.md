OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force and like, holy crap, what a ride! 🛫✨ I’m telling you, if I spent as much time at the gym as I do 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 these epics, I’d be able to lift all the luggage in the overhead bins with one hand! So, it’s like this crazy mash-up of epic battles and, you know, the kind of drama that makes my in-flight soap operas look like a kiddie's play, seriously. 

Random side note: I didn’t even think I’d like it this much. I only 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   on a whim when it was on sale in the app. You know, one of those days you’re stuck in another time zone and hope something interesting pops on the screen. 🙄 I mean, it’s all gods and demons throwing lightning bolts and trying to one-up each other with epic (and sometimes cheesy) speeches! Lol, but tell me why the gods are always the most dramatic beings? Like chill bro, have you even tried decaf? 🤣

And don’t get me started on the visuals! Some scenes were just 🔥🔥 The colors, those battle sequences – wham, bam, thank you ma’am! I did have to pause it a few times because it was just so visually intense. Unlike when I was trying to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   on the flight last week and the dude next to me was elbow wrestling with me for the armrest. Ugh, remembered why I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to my phone. 

But yeah, the   did this funny thing – one moment you’re all “woohoo, superhero gods!” and the next moment, boom, here comes heavy emotional baggage out of nowhere and I’m sitting there like, what? More of that stuff than in overbooked Economy, you know? 😂 So yeah, if you wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you’re avoiding responsibilities, I'd recommend it. It’s like a roller coaster through a lightning storm.

Anyway, remember that crazy layover we had in Tokyo? This   is kinda like that—energetic and all over the place! Oh, and was I the only one noticing how the hero always had perfect hair during battles? I can barely keep mine together after one flight. Real life, right? 🤷‍♀️

print(Why did I even add this?)

Finally, guess where my head was halfway into the  ? Thinking how I could incorporate some of those smooth moves next time a cabin door gets stuck. 😂 Hey, maybe get these gods to do a demo if they’re not too busy battling armies. Ahhh, my head’s still spinning, and I need to crash now before tomorrow’s flight. Let me know if you decide to check it out! Would love to compare notes! ✈️💤
